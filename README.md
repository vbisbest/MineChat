# MineChat

## Well it was a good ride!  

I am open sourcing MineChat for all to see.  I started MineChat back in 2013 just as a fun project and learn how to write mobile apps.   But it became too time consuming to keep up with the Minecraft updates and eventually I had to just stop as I have a full time job, family and other hobbies. 

The code is 2 years old and no longer works with todays versions of Minecraft. The updates stopped when Microsoft changed their login process. Perhaps the source code can be useful to others to see some of the inner workings of Minecraft and what goes into making a cross platform mobile application.  Code snippets may still be useful for those who wish to make some of their own Minecraft tools.    

I want to personally thank all of MineChat's users, fans and volunteers that have contributed along the way.  It was a lot of fun and hope that this code may be useful in some way.   Happy Minecrafting!
